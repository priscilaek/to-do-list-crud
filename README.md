# To-Do List App

Welcome to my To-Do List App! In this project, I've created a simple yet effective application that covers all four CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- Add tasks to your list.
- Update task details.
- Delete completed tasks by Done.
- View your pending tasks.

## How to Use

1. **Adding Tasks**: Simply enter your task description in the input field and click the "Add Task" button.

2. **Updating Tasks**: If you need to modify a task, click the "Update" button, edit the task text, and save the changes.

3. **Deleting Completed Tasks**: Once a task is done, you can mark it as complete using the provided "Done" button.

4. **Viewing Pending Tasks**: Easily keep track of pending tasks by reading the list of tasks displayed on the app.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM structure for the front-end.
- Local storage to store your tasks between sessions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. Start managing your tasks!
